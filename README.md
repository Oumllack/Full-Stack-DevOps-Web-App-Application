# Modern Voting Application

A full-stack, cloud-native voting application built with modern technologies and best practices in DevOps.

## 🚀 Overview

This application provides a modern, real-time voting platform where users can create polls, vote on them, and see results instantly. The application is designed with scalability, security, and user experience in mind.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM, and large ecosystem
- **Material-UI**: Provides a beautiful, responsive design system with pre-built components
- **React Router**: Handles client-side routing efficiently
- **Axios**: Manages HTTP requests with promise-based architecture
- **Framer Motion**: Adds smooth animations and transitions for better UX

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Provides a non-blocking I/O model perfect for real-time applications
- **Express.js**: Lightweight and flexible web application framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust, scalable relational database with JSON support
- **pg (node-postgres)**: Native PostgreSQL client for Node.js

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for AWS resource management
- **AWS Services**:
  - **ECS**: Container orchestration
  - **RDS**: Managed PostgreSQL database
  - **S3**: Static file storage
  - **CloudFront**: CDN for global content delivery
  - **VPC**: Network isolation and security
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation

## 🌟 Key Features

- Real-time voting updates
- Responsive design for all devices
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Cloud-native architecture
- Scalable infrastructure
- Automated deployment pipeline
- High availability and fault tolerance

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture pattern:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Single Page Application (SPA)
   - Client-side routing
   - Responsive design
   - Real-time updates

2. **Backend Layer**
   - RESTful API
   - JSON data format
   - Database abstraction
   - Error handling

3. **Database Layer**
   - PostgreSQL with JSON support
   - Optimized queries
   - Data integrity constraints

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Containerized deployment
   - Auto-scaling capabilities
   - Load balancing
   - CDN integration

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - Docker Compose for local environment
   - Hot-reloading for both frontend and backend
   - Local PostgreSQL instance

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Security scanning
   - Automated deployment

3. **Deployment**
   - Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
   - Container orchestration with ECS
   - Database migrations
   - Static asset distribution

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
